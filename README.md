# CS50 Readability (Flask)

Taken from CS50's Sentimental Readability, this is a flask app which computes the reading grade of text excerpts using the Coleman-Liau index

## Features

- **3D Flip-Card UI**: A card that flips to reveal the grade after submission, then flips back to allow new entries.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both mobile and desktop.
- **Customizable Styles**: Uses CSS gradients, fonts from Google Fonts, and smooth transitions.
